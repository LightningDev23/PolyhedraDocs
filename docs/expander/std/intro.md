# Standard Circuits

We provide several standard circuits, available in both Go and Rust frontends. These circuits are similar to the standard library in gnark and can be used to build more complex circuits, helping developers quickly construct their own circuits.

## LogUp

We have both a [Go version](https://github.com/PolyhedraZK/ExpanderCompilerCollection/tree/dev/circuit-std-go/logup) and a [Rust version](https://github.com/PolyhedraZK/ExpanderCompilerCollection/blob/dev/circuit-std-rs/src/logup.rs) of the LogUp circuit. Detailed information can be found [here](./logup).

## Poseidon M31

We have both a [Go version](https://github.com/PolyhedraZK/ExpanderCompilerCollection/tree/dev/circuit-std-go/poseidon-m31) and a [Rust version](https://github.com/PolyhedraZK/ExpanderCompilerCollection/blob/dev/circuit-std-rs/src/poseidon_m31.rs) of the Poseidon M31 circuit. Please refer to the code for more information.
