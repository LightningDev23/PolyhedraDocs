# Quick Guide

If you’re a developer interested in building applications on the EXP Chain, this document provides all the essential information you’ll need

## Getting Started

EXP Chain is a high-performance blockchain network.

Since EXP Chain is EVM-compatible, your existing Ethereum contract skills will seamlessly transfer to EXP Chain.

## Connecting to EXP Chain Testnet

Here are some resources to help you get connected to the EXP Chain network:

- [Network Information and RPC Providers](https://github.com/PolyhedraZK/chaindocs?tab=readme-ov-file#json-rpc)
- [Wallet Configuration](https://github.com/PolyhedraZK/chaindocs?tab=readme-ov-file#wallet-configuration)

## Obtain Testnet Tokens

EXP is the native utility token of EXP Chain and is used to pay transaction fees.

- [EXP Chain Testnet Faucet](https://expchain.ai/faucet)

- For the mainnet, you can withdraw tokens directly from a centralized exchange (CEX) that supports the EXP Chain network (e.g., OKX).

## JSON-RPC API

Interacting with EXP Chain requires sending requests to specific JSON-RPC API methods. EXP Chain’s APIs are compatible with Geth. - [JSON-RPC API](https://github.com/PolyhedraZK/chaindocs?tab=readme-ov-file#json-rpc)
