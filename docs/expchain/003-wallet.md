- Symbol: tEXP
- Explorer: [https://blockscout-testnet.expchain.ai](https://blockscout-testnet.expchain.ai)
- tendermint-sidechain: [https://tendermint-sidechain-testnet.expchain.ai](https://tendermint-sidechain-testnet.expchain.ai)
- abci-sidechain: [https://abci-sidechain-testnet.expchain.ai](https://abci-sidechain-testnet.expchain.ai)
- Multicall: 0x7406c4F36c0DCc3E3FC8cC1b1F9771DaFF3CE5d0
- WEXP: 0x46F2038afa5CDD1a8CD444DB923279ADe1208a48
- tZKJ on Sepolia: 0x465C15e9e2F3837472B0B204e955c5205270CA9E
- tZKJ on BSC Testnet: 0xbBF8F565995c3fDF890120e6AbC48c4f818b03c2

> ðŸŒŸ tEXP is the native token on the EXP Chain Testnet. tZKJ is the test token of ZKJ on the Ethereum Sepolia Testnet and BNB Chain Testnet. tZKJ and tEXP have a 1:1 exchange ratio. They exist in the form of tEXP on the EXP Chain Testnet and in the form of tZKJ on the Ethereum Sepolia Testnet and BNB Chain Testnet. You can convert tZKJ on the Ethereum Sepolia Testnet and BNB Chain Testnet to tEXP on the EXP Chain Testnet by zkBridge.

## Reference - How to configure Metamask

After you install the metamask in your browser, you can go to settings -> networks -> add network page. Select add manual network and enter the network information.

Depending on your location and preference, you can choose from a variety of RPC endpoints for EXP Chain. For more information about the endpoints and their features, please refer to [the network information document](https://github.com/PolyhedraZK/chaindocs?tab=readme-ov-file#json-rpc) that we have prepared for you. To ensure the best performance and user experience, you can test the latency of each endpoint before you configure it with your wallet.
