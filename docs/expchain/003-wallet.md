Depending on your location and preference, you can choose from a variety of RPC endpoints for EXP Chain. For more information about the endpoints and their features, please refer to [the network information document](002-rpc.md) that we have prepared for you. To ensure the best performance and user experience, you can test the latency of each endpoint before you configure it with your wallet.
